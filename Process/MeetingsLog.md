# TEAM SCRUM AND MEETING LOG

## Pre-Sprint 1 Meeting Log (Wednesday, Jan 3rd)

Zain, Erin, and Chris met in person for 5-6 hours at HKS; Bobi worked remotely.

General Meeting Accomplishments: DOT Dataset selected and culled down/edited, day spent mainly preparing DOT dataset for analysis, setting up skeleton web page with placeholder text, exploring potential visualizations, planning potential predictive models.

Zain and Chris did a lot of data manipulation within python in order to aggregate the DOT data for multiple years and filter down to the data points that we wanted to focus on.

## Sprint 1 Meeting (in-class, Friday, Jan 5th)

Redirects since last meeting (diminishing scope of what we plan to visualize with datasets):

Chris: Will now be working on table of aircraft type and summary statistics. Goal: better understand why companies choose the planes that they do for certain routes. What can you conclude about the type of plane that you’re assigned. Audience: traveler

Zain: length of delays from one hub only (say, Boston to six different destinations)

Erin: focusing on flight airport traffic influence on delays...combining two simple datasets

Bobi: instead of using API/FlightAware, will no longer be using live data but will focus on the role of “dates” i.e. day of the week, day of the month, and how this influences delays.

Blockers: Figuring out how to do D3 visualizations with existing data (how to navigate JavaScript primarily)

GENERAL GOALS FOR SECOND SPRINT:
* Meet in person
* Create user stories and gather consensus on these by beginning of first scrum meeting for second sprint (1.9.2018)

## In-Person Work Meeting (in-person, Saturday, Jan 6th)

Erin, Chris, Zain, and Bobi met in person at HKS for ~ 8 hrs

General goals for meeting: get working d3 visualizations on each page and have them linked to our datasets.

General accomplishments: each person has an active visualization on their site! Much troubleshooting was completed for the different errors that were creating problematic presentations (or non-presentations) of the visualizations. Next steps: adding text content, data methods and descriptions to each page


## Sprint 2 Meeting (in-class, Monday Jan 8th)
	
Blockers: figuring out the final details for project submission and discerning whether or not we are missing any of these.


## In-Person Meeting (in-person, Tuesday, Jan 9th) 

Zain, Erin, Bobi, and Chris met for ~5hrs at HKS

Accomplishments: general debugging, adding elements to d3 visualizations, creating consistent storyline, adding text to each page, checking for typos, developing story, integrating design elements.


## In-Person Meeting (in-person, Thursday, Jan 11th)

Zain, Erin, Bobi, Chris (~3hrs at HKS)

Accomplishments: complete homepage content, added style features and new images for navigation menu.

Blockers: none...just remembering that Chris is leaving early so we will need all of his content by Friday

## Final In-Person Meeting (in-person, Friday, Jan 12th)

Friday afternoon in-person for ~3hours (Bobi, Zain, and Erin in person...Chris via slack/text)

Tasks: compiling process notes, creating burn-down chart, making small final changes to site (Zain fixing a few data errors, Bobi making sure visualizations are properly labeled), everyone compiling separate readme files to document our processes for:
1. gathering and cleaning up our datasets...and linking to the data sources
1. describing the alterations that we made to our visualizations
