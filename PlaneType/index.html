  <H1>Which type of planes are most susceptible to delays?</H1>

  <h2>Source of Data</h2>
  <p>Data was gathered from the Department of Transportation's web site  <A HREF="https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time">On-Time Performances table</A>, for all flights departing from the top 50 busiest US airports in 2017.  We chose to look at trends for the 7 most common types of aircraft. </p>

  <p>Two charts are below.

The first is a stacked bar chart which indicates percent occurrence of delay, categorized into 5 levels. For this, we filtered down just to flights that were departing Boston. This chart is interactive, so you can click on each delay category in the legend to see a subset of the data.  This chart was made with Plotly.js</p>



  <h2>Insights for Chart 1 - Flights Departing from Boston</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>You have the greatest chance of arriving more than 180 minutes late if you fly on a 717</b>.</li>
  <li>You have the greatest chance of arriving early if you fly on either a 737 or A319 (however, the A319 also has the second highest occurrence of flights delayed more than 180 minutes)</li>
  <li>You have the greatest chance of arriving early or within 15 minutes of your scheduled arrival if you fly on a CL-600</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Insights for Chart 2 - Flights Departing from Top 50 Busiest Airports in US</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>You have the greatest chance of arriving on-time if you fly on a 717 (note this trend is different from that of just flights departing from Boston).</li>
  <li>You have the lowest chance of arriving on-time if you fly on a CL-600 (note this trend is different from that of just flights departing from Boston)</li>
  </ul>
