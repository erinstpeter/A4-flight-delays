<h1>Does passenger traffic impact flight delays?</h1>

<p>In order to investigate the role of passenger traffic as it relates to the likelihood of experienceing a flight delay, we compiled a database of the thrity US airports with the highest passenger traffic in 2016. It turns out that Atlanta had the highest amount of passenger traffic (measured in # persons boarding) in this time period. The top five airports and the 30th airport ranked by passenger traffic are listed below:</p>

	<p><ul>
		<li> #1: Atlanta (ATL) : 50,476,272</li>
		<li> #2: Los Angeles (LAX) : 39,635,691</li>
		<li> #3: Chicago (ORD) : 37,499,201</li>
		<li> #4: Dallas (DFW) : 31,274,875</li>
		<li> #5: New York (JFK) : 29,224,554</li>
		<li> ...</li>
		<li> #30: Portland, OR (PDX) : 9,071,154</li>

	</ul></p>

<p>To better visualize the correlation between the amount of airport traffic and the likelihood of eperiencing a delay we took the same list of airports from above and arranged them by airport traffic (size of bubble) and average percentage of on-time flights in 2016 (indicated by color). Blue indicates on-time departures of 84% to 87% (highest value in sample), purple indicates on-time departures of 80-84%, and red indicates on-time departures of 80% to 71% (lowest value in sample).
