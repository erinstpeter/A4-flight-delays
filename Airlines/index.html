		<p>Flight delay is a serious and widespread problem in the United States. In 2007, nearly one in four airline flights arrived at its destination over 15 minutes late (BTS,  2009).  About  a  third  of  
		these  late  arrivals  were  a  direct  result  of  the  inability  of  the  aviation  system  to  handle  the  traffic  demands  that  were  placed  upon  it,  while  another  third  resulted  from  airline  internal  problems. Most of the remainder was caused by an aircraft arriving late and thus having to depart late on its next flight (BTS, 2009). </p>

		<p>As a frequent flier from Boston to other major cities, it is very useful to check the length of flight delays to plan your trip to the airport.</p>
		<p>Below is a bar graph that charts predicted length of delays for various airlines flyiing out of Boston.</p>
