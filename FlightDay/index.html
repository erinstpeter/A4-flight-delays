	<H1>When is the best time to fly if you want to avoid flight delays?</H1>

	<p>Does the time of flight affect the chances of it being delayed? Is there a preferred day or month to fly if you want to minimize the chances of your flight being delayed?</p>

	<h2>Source of Data</h2>
	<p>Data was gathered from the Department of Transportation's web site  <A HREF="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/">On-Time Performances Table</A>, between November 2016 and October 2017 (inclusive).</p>
	<p>The data was processed in order to create a histogram of late flights by different time periods. Delay is considered when a flight arrived more than 15 minutes after its planned time. The data includes all domestic flights and delays for all reasons (security, weather, etc.)</p>

	<p>For any available graph (day of week, day of month, and month of year) the percentage of delayed flights is shown. The category with the most delays is marked with a <font color="#c94c4c"><b>red</b></font> bar, while the category with the least delays is marked with a <font color="#86af49"><b>green</b></font> bar.</p>

	<h2>Insights</h2>
	<ul>

	<li>The <b>7th</b> day of every month has the highest chance of having a delayed flight (over 21%).</li>
	<li><b>December</b> is the worst month to fly if you want to avoid flight delays. The chances of your flight being delayed in <b>November</b> are almost <b>10%</b> less than in December.</li>
	</ul>
