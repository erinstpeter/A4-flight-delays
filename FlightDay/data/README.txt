Visualization

http://bl.ocks.org/juan-cb/1afee8f2cae799e86707

Changes I've made to the visualization:
1. Added support to switch between datasets with different x axis categories
2. In the example the data was hardcoded. I've changed the code to load external CSV files.
3. Added id property so that can change style only to chart.
4. [TODO] Color the best and worst to emphasize
